\title{Model average firing as a function treatment using log-poisson regression}
\usage{
model_treatment_log_poisson(experiment,
  output_base = "intermediate_data/models", verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\description{
experiment:
  experiment dataset loaded with mema::load_experiment(...)
}
\details{
extra ... arguments are passed to brms::brm(...)

returns:
  brmsfit from the brms package

Build a bayesian heirarchical model for the number of firings as a function of

exposure with a weight fixed at 1
   => offset(log(exposure))
   https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms/issues/146

treatment as a fixed effect
   => treatment

average neuron firing rate as a random effet
   => (1|neuron_index)

assume a general linear model with log-poisson link

This uses the brms package front end to the stan bayesian modeling framework
